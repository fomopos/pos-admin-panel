### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pos-admin-panel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Cognito**
   
   Update `src/auth/config.ts` with your AWS Cognito settings:
   ```typescript
   export const cognitoConfig = {
     region: 'your-aws-region',
     userPoolId: 'your-user-pool-id',
     userPoolWebClientId: 'your-client-id',
   };
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 Configuration

### AWS Cognito Setup

2. **Configure App Client** with appropriate settings
3. **Update configuration** in `src/auth/config.ts`
4. **Set up hosted UI** (optional) for additional authentication flows

### Translation API

The application expects translation endpoints at:
- `GET /api/translations/en` - English translations
- `GET /api/translations/es` - Spanish translations

Example response format:
```json

    "delete": "Delete"
  },
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "Dashboard",
    "totalSales": "Total Sales"
  }
}
```

### Tenant API

Multi-tenant data should be scoped using tenant ID:
- `GET /api/tenants/{tenantId}/products`
- `GET /api/tenants/{tenantId}/sales`
- `GET /api/tenants/{tenantId}/customers`
- `GET /api/tenants/{tenantId}/categories`
