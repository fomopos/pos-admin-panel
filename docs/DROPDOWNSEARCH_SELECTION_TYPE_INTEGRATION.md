# DropdownSearch Integration for Selection Type

## Summary
Successfully replaced the native HTML select element with the DropdownSearch component for the Selection Type field in ProductModifierManager to maintain consistent theming throughout the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added `DropdownSearch` to the UI component imports
- Added `DropdownSearchOption` type import

### 2. Created Selection Type Options
```typescript
const selectionTypeOptions: DropdownSearchOption[] = [
  {
    id: 'single',
    label: 'Single Selection (1)',
    description: 'Customer picks exactly one option'
  },
  {
    id: 'multiple',
    label: 'Multiple Selection (unlimited)',
    description: 'Customer can pick any number of options'
  },
  {
    id: 'exact',
    label: 'Exact Selection (specify number)',
    description: 'Customer must pick exactly N options'
  },
  {
    id: 'limited',
    label: 'Limited Selection (min-max range)',
    description: 'Customer picks within a specified range'
  }
];
```

### 3. Replaced Native Select with DropdownSearch
- Maintains the same functionality and logic
- Adds enhanced UI with descriptions for each option
- Uses consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Includes proper disabled state handling
- Preserves all selection type change logic

## UI/UX Improvements

### Enhanced Visual Design
- **Consistent Theming**: Now matches the application's design system
- **Rich Option Display**: Each option shows both label and description
- **Better Accessibility**: Improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Professional Appearance**: Matches other dropdowns in the application

### User Experience
- **Clear Descriptions**: Each selection type includes helpful description text
- **Intuitive Interface**: Familiar dropdown behavior consistent with other forms
- **Visual Feedback**: Proper hover and focus states
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes

## Custom Configuration

### DropdownSearch Properties Used
- `label`: "Selection Type"
- `value`: Current selection type
- `options`: Array of selection type options with descriptions
- `onSelect`: Handles selection changes with same logic as before
- `disabled`: Respects the disabled prop
- `closeOnSelect`: Closes dropdown after selection
- `allowClear`: Disabled to prevent clearing required selection
- `displayValue`: Shows selected option label
- `renderOption`: Custom rendering with label and description

### Custom Option Rendering
Each option displays:
- **Primary Label**: Selection type name (e.g., "Single Selection (1)")
- **Description**: Helpful explanation of what the type does
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches application theme

## Benefits

2. **Better User Experience**: More intuitive and informative interface
3. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Better keyboard and screen reader support
4. **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend with additional features
5. **Professional Appearance**: More polished than native HTML select
