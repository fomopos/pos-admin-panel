  - Grid and list view modes
  - Pagination for large employee lists
  - Bulk actions support (import employees)
  - Smart button management following STYLING_GUIDE patterns
  - Real-time search with debouncing
  - Delete confirmation dialogs
  - Employee status management

### 2. Employee Create/Edit Form (`/employees/new`, `/employees/:id/edit`)

- **Planned Features**:
  - Shift planning and scheduling
  - Time slot management
  - Schedule templates
  - Calendar-based interface
  - Recurring schedule patterns

#### Employee Time Tracking (`/employees/:id/time-tracking`)
- **File**: `src/pages/employees/EmployeeTimeTracking.tsx`
- **Planned Features**:
  - Clock in/out functionality
  - Break time tracking
  - Timesheet management
  - Hours calculation
  - Overtime tracking

#### Employee Performance (`/employees/:id/performance`)
- **File**: `src/pages/employees/EmployeePerformance.tsx`
- **Planned Features**:
  - Sales metrics
  - Productivity reports
  - Performance reviews
  - Goal tracking
  - Performance analytics

## Component Architecture

### State Management
- Uses local React state with proper TypeScript typing
- Implements change tracking for smart UI updates
- Error state management with field-specific validation
- Loading states for async operations

### Navigation Integration
- Added to main navigation under "Employee Management"
- Permission-based visibility (requires user management permissions)
- Breadcrumb navigation between related pages
- Back navigation with unsaved changes detection

### Form Validation Framework
```typescript
interface ValidationErrors {
  [key: string]: string;
}

const validateForm = (): boolean => {
  const newErrors: ValidationErrors = {};
  
  // Email validation
  if (!formData.email.trim()) {
    newErrors.email = 'Email is required';
  } else if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(formData.email)) {
    newErrors.email = 'Please enter a valid email address';
  }
  
  // ... other validations
  
  setErrors(newErrors);
  return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0;
};
```

### Smart Button Management
Following STYLING_GUIDE patterns:
- **Save Button**: Visible only when changes exist and not saving
- **Discard Button**: Visible only when changes exist and not saving  
- **Cancel Button**: Visible when no changes or currently saving
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during save operations

### API Integration
- Uses existing `userService` for CRUD operations
- Implements proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Supports both create and update operations
- Handles API timeouts and network errors gracefully

## Styling & Design

### Component Consistency
- Uses existing UI component library (`components/ui`)
- Follows established color schemes and spacing
- Implements proper responsive design
- Uses consistent typography and iconography

### Badge Component
Created custom `Badge` component for status indicators:
```typescript
interface BadgeProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  color?: 'green' | 'red' | 'yellow' | 'blue' | 'gray' | 'orange' | 'purple';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  className?: string;
}
```

### Card Layout System
- Employee cards in grid view with comprehensive information
- Employee rows in list view for compact display
- Responsive design adapting to screen size
- Consistent hover effects and transitions

## Data Models

### Employee Form Data
```typescript
interface EmployeeFormData {
  email: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  phone: string;
  role: string;
  role_name: string;
  employee_id: string;
  department: string;
  hire_date: string;
  pin_code: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'suspended';
  two_factor_enabled: boolean;
}
```

### Employee Statistics
```typescript
interface EmployeeStats {
  total: number;
  active: number;
  inactive: number;
  clockedIn: number;
  onBreak: number;
}
```

## Routes Added
```typescript
// Employee Management Routes
<Route path="employees" element={<EmployeeManagement />} />
<Route path="employees/new" element={<EmployeeEdit />} />
<Route path="employees/:id/edit" element={<EmployeeEdit />} />
<Route path="employees/:id/schedule" element={<EmployeeSchedule />} />
<Route path="employees/:id/time-tracking" element={<EmployeeTimeTracking />} />
<Route path="employees/:id/performance" element={<EmployeePerformance />} />
```

## File Structure
```
src/pages/employees/
├── index.ts                    # Exports
├── EmployeeManagement.tsx      # Main list page
├── EmployeeEdit.tsx           # Create/edit form
├── EmployeeSchedule.tsx       # Schedule management (placeholder)
├── EmployeeTimeTracking.tsx   # Time tracking (placeholder)
└── EmployeePerformance.tsx    # Performance analytics (placeholder)
```

## Integration Points

### Permission System
- Integrates with existing permission system
- Uses `canManageUsers()` permission check
- Properly hides features based on user permissions

### Tenant/Store Context
- Uses `useTenantStore` for store context
- Filters employees by current store
- Respects tenant-level settings

### Translation Support
- Ready for i18n integration
- Uses consistent translation key patterns
- Supports multiple languages
