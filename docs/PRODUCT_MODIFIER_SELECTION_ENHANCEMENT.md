# Product Modifier Selection Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the product modifier system to provide flexible selection options beyond just "single" and "multiple". Users can now specify exact numbers of selections for precise control over customer choices.

## New Selection Types

### 1. Single Selection (unchanged)
- Allows exactly 1 selection
- Customers must pick one option
- Example: Size selection (Small, Medium, Large)

### 2. Multiple Selection (unchanged)
- Allows unlimited selections
- Customers can pick any number of options
- Example: Pizza toppings

### 3. Exact Selection (NEW)
- Allows exactly N selections where N is user-defined
- Customers must pick exactly the specified number
- Example: "Choose exactly 3 toppings" or "Pick exactly 2 sides"

### 4. Limited Selection (enhanced)
- Allows min-max range of selections
- Customers can pick between minimum and maximum numbers
- Example: "Choose 2-4 toppings" or "Pick 1-3 sides"

## Implementation Details

### Type Definitions
```typescript
export interface ProductModifierGroup {
  selection_type: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'exact' | 'limited';
  exact_selections?: number; // For 'exact' type
  max_selections?: number; // For 'limited' type
  min_selections?: number; // For 'limited' type
  // ... other fields
}
```

### UI Components
- **Selection Type Dropdown**: Now includes "Exact Selection" option
- **Exact Selections Field**: Appears when "exact" type is selected
- **Dynamic Header Display**: Shows selection rules clearly (e.g., "exactly 3 selections")
- **Validation**: Real-time validation for all selection types

### Validation Rules

#### Exact Selection Type
- `exact_selections` must be at least 1
- Cannot require more selections than available modifiers
- For required groups: must have exactly N default modifiers (where N = exact_selections)
- For optional groups: can have 0 to N default modifiers

#### Enhanced Limited Selection
- `min_selections` cannot be negative
- `min_selections` cannot exceed `max_selections`
- Cannot have more default modifiers than `max_selections`

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Burger Combo Sides
```
Selection Type: Exact Selection (2)
Required: Yes
Modifiers: [Fries, Onion Rings, Coleslaw, Salad]
Result: Customer must choose exactly 2 sides
```

### Example 2: Coffee Customization
```
Selection Type: Limited Selection (1-3)
Required: No
Modifiers: [Extra Shot, Decaf, Soy Milk, Oat Milk, Extra Hot]
Result: Customer can choose 1, 2, or 3 customizations
```

### Example 3: Pizza Size (unchanged)
```
Selection Type: Single Selection
Required: Yes
Modifiers: [Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large]
Result: Customer must choose exactly 1 size
```

## Benefits

1. **Precise Control**: Restaurant owners can specify exact numbers for combo meals, set menus, etc.
2. **Better UX**: Clear indication of how many selections are required/allowed
3. **Flexible Business Rules**: Supports various pricing and portion control strategies
4. **Validation**: Prevents configuration errors and ensures logical setups

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Clear Labels**: Selection types have descriptive labels
- **Contextual Fields**: Only relevant input fields are shown
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible default values when changing selection types
- **Visual Feedback**: Group headers show selection rules at a glance
- **Helper Text**: Clear descriptions for each field

## Migration Notes

- Existing modifier groups remain compatible
- New `exact_selections` field is optional and only used for 'exact' type
- Default behavior unchanged for existing 'single' and 'multiple' types
- Enhanced validation provides better error messages

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Create Exact Selection Group**: Test with various exact numbers
2. **Default Modifiers**: Ensure correct number of defaults for exact selection
3. **Validation**: Test edge cases (too many defaults, insufficient modifiers)
4. **Type Switching**: Test changing between selection types
5. **Required vs Optional**: Test behavior differences

## Future Enhancements

- **Conditional Logic**: Base selections on other choices
- **Pricing Rules**: Different pricing for different selection counts
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder modifiers within groups
- **Templates**: Save common modifier group configurations
