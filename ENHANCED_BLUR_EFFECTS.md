# Enhanced Blur Effects in ConfirmDialog

## Overview
Updated the ConfirmDialog component with enhanced blur effects for a more sophisticated glassmorphism design and improved visual hierarchy.

## Blur Changes Made

### 1. **Background Backdrop Blur**
```css
/* Before */
backdropFilter: 'blur(8px) saturate(180%)'

/* After */
backdropFilter: 'blur(16px) saturate(150%)'
```
**Improvement**: Doubled the blur intensity for a more dramatic background separation while slightly reducing saturation for better readability.

### 2. **Modal Panel Blur**
```css
/* Before */
bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-md
backdropFilter: 'blur(20px) saturate(200%)'

/* After */
bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-xl
backdropFilter: 'blur(24px) saturate(180%)'
```
**Improvement**: Increased blur for a stronger glassmorphism effect, reduced opacity slightly for more translucency, and adjusted saturation for better balance.

### 3. **Close Button Blur**
```css
/* Before */
bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm
backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)'

/* After */
bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md
backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)'
```
**Improvement**: Enhanced opacity and blur for better button definition while maintaining translucency.

### 4. **Icon Container Blur**
```css
/* Before */
backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)'
background opacity: 0.8

/* After */
backdropFilter: 'blur(14px)'
background opacity: 0.9
```
**Improvement**: Increased blur and opacity for better icon background definition.

### 5. **Action Buttons Blur**
```css
/* Before */
backdrop-blur-sm
backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)'

/* After */
backdrop-blur-md
backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)'
```
**Improvement**: Enhanced blur for better button depth and visual appeal.

### 6. **Cancel Button Blur**
```css
/* Before */
bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm
backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)'

/* After */
bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md
backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)'
```
**Improvement**: Consistent blur enhancement with increased opacity for better visibility.
