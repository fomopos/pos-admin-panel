📋 Manual Testing Instructions:

1. Open the User Management page in your browser: http://localhost:5173/settings/users

2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab

3. Look for these positive indicators:
   ✅ No "Failed to fetch" errors
   ✅ Console warnings like "API call failed, using mock data for development"
   ✅ User list displays with mock data
   ✅ User statistics show on the page
   ✅ No red error messages in the UI

4. Test navigation:
   - Click on user names to view details
   - Try to edit a user
   - Attempt to create a new user
   - Check user activity and time tracking

5. Verify mock data fallback:
   - All operations should work with mock data
   - No network errors should break the interface
   - The interface should be fully functional in development mode

🎯 Expected Results:
- The User Management interface loads completely
- Mock data is displayed for users, statistics, activities
- All CRUD operations work with mock data
- No "Failed to fetch" errors appear
- Console shows warnings instead of errors when API calls fail
