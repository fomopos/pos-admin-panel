# 🔧 TENANT SELECTION FLOW FIX

## 🐛 Issue Identified
After login, users were being routed to tenant-store-selection page, but the organization (tenant) and store were already pre-selected, skipping the proper selection flow.

## ✅ Root Cause
The `TenantStoreSelection` component had logic that would:
1. Automatically move to store selection if a tenant was already selected
2. Not clear existing tenant/store selections when initializing
3. Allow auto-navigation based on existing state rather than user action

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### **1. Clear Selections on Initialize**
```typescript
// ADDED: Clear existing selections to force proper flow
useEffect(() => {
  const initializeSelection = async () => {
    // Clear any existing tenant/store selections to force proper flow
    switchTenant(''); // This also clears currentStore automatically
    
    const user = await authService.getCurrentUser();
    if (user?.email) {
      await fetchTenants(user.email);
    }
    
    // Ensure we start at tenant selection step
    setStep('tenant');
  };
  
  initializeSelection();
}, [fetchTenants, switchTenant]);
```

### **2. Fixed Auto-Navigation Logic**
```typescript
// FIXED: Only navigate after user completes the flow
useEffect(() => {
  // Only redirect if user completes the selection flow properly
  // Don't auto-navigate based on existing selections
  if (currentTenant && currentStore && step === 'store') {
    navigate(intendedDestination, { replace: true });
  }
}, [currentTenant, currentStore, navigate, intendedDestination, step]);
```

## 🎯 New Behavior

### **Before Fix:**
```
Login → TenantStoreSelection Page
  ↓
Auto-detects existing tenant → Skips to Store Selection
  ↓
Auto-detects existing store → Redirects to Dashboard
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Login → TenantStoreSelection Page
  ↓
STEP 1: User must select Organization (tenant cleared)
  ↓
STEP 2: User must select Store (within chosen organization)
  ↓
STEP 3: Navigate to intended destination
```

## ✅ Verification

### **Expected Flow:**
1. **Login** → User authenticates successfully
2. **Navigate** → Redirect to `/tenant-store-selection`
3. **Step 1** → User sees "Select Organization" with available tenants
4. **Step 2** → After tenant selection, user sees "Select Store"
5. **Complete** → After store selection, navigate to dashboard

### **UI Behavior:**
- ✅ Progress indicator shows "Organization" as active step initially
- ✅ No pre-selected organizations
- ✅ User must click to select organization
- ✅ Only after organization selection, store step becomes available
- ✅ User must click to select store
- ✅ Only after both selections, navigation to dashboard occurs

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. **Login to application**
2. **Verify redirect to `/tenant-store-selection`**
3. **Confirm organization selection step is active**
4. **Verify no pre-selected organizations**
5. **Select an organization**
6. **Verify automatic move to store selection step**
7. **Select a store**
8. **Verify navigation to dashboard**

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The tenant selection flow now correctly forces users to go through the proper hierarchical selection process:
**Organization Selection → Store Selection → Dashboard Access**
